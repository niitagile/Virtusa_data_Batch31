To run the frontend, you have to install and configure nginx on your system because we have used html, css and javascript for our frontend and not angular or react, that's why we had to create our own server with the help of nginx.

And also, backend project should also be running on your system otherwise you will not be able to hit the apis from the frontend.

Follow the below steps to install and configure nginx on your system:
1. sudo apt update
2. sudo apt install nginx
3. cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
4. sudo touch home
5. sudo gedit home
6. Paste the configuration given at the bottom of this file into home file
7. sudo cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/home /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
8. systemctl restart nginx
9. Go to browser and hit http://localhost:3001


Configuration:
server {
	listen 3001;
	root /home/ritik/Desktop/payment-billing-frontend;
	index login.html;
	
	location /admin/ {
		autoindex on;
	}
	
	location /accountant/ {
		autoindex on;
	}
}
