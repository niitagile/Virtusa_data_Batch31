To run the frontend, you have to install and configure nginx on your system.
OR!! 
You can also use docker, then you don't need to do any configuration. (Just go to the folder Team 7 Frontend Docker and follow the steps written in the readme file)

And obviously, backend project should also be running on your system otherwise you will not be able to hit the apis from the frontend.

Follow the below steps to install and configure nginx on your system:
1. sudo apt update
2. sudo apt install nginx
3. sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
4. sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
5. cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
6. sudo touch home
7. sudo gedit home
8. Paste the configuration given at the bottom of this file into the editor
9. sudo cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/home /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
10. systemctl restart nginx
11. Go to browser and hit http://localhost:3001


Configuration:
server {
	listen 3001;
	root /home/ritik/Desktop/payment-billing-frontend (you have to change this path to where you have saved the project into your system);
	index login.html;
	
	location /admin/ {
		autoindex on;
	}
	
	location /accountant/ {
		autoindex on;
	}
}
